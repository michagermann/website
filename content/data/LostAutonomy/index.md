### Description ###

Influential contributions posit that centralization and the imposition of direct rule constitute key causes of the emergence of separatist nationalism and the escalation of separatist claims to violence. However, the empirical study of the role of autonomy loss in conflict processes has been limited by the fact that the main extant source of data on lost autonomy – the Minorities at Risk (MAR) dataset – covers only a small and biased sample of all ethnic groups around the world (Hug 2013). 

We provide new and improved data on autonomy loss for more than 750 ethnic groups from the Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) dataset, version 2014. Our data identify all major autonomy downgrades during the period from 1800 to 2012. The data can be used for the identification of ethnic groups that have suffered from autonomy loss since 1800 or any other cut-off after 1800. 

The data and documentation can be downloaded [here](/files/LostAutonomy.zip).
