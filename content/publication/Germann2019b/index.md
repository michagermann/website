abstract: "The international community increasingly promotes referendums as it intervenes in conflicts over self-determination. However, much of the existing literature is skeptical of the potential of such referendums to contribute to conflict resolution. Arguing against the prevailing scholarly opinion, this paper develops a theory that self-determination referendums can help to build a foundation for peace via the generation of political legitimacy. However, this requires that self-determination referendums do justice to conflicting claims to self-determination and are initiated with mutual consent. Unilateral self-determination referendums, by contrast, are likely to increase nationalist grievances and, thus, the risk of war. I find support for my argument in a series of case studies and a cross-national analysis of more than 100 self-determination referendums held in the context of noncolonial separatist conflicts, 1946â€“2012. Overall, the findings of this study so far suggest that self-determination referendums can make a contribution to peace, but only if the conditions are ripe and prior agreement on referendums can be found. I am currently working on a survey experiment to shed further light on the causal relationship between self-determination referendums initiated with or without mutual consent and legitimacy perceptions as well as the willingness to accept unfavorable decision outcomes."
