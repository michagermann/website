abstract: "Can existing models of civil war onset explain why some conflicts turn violent while others stay nonviolent? While it is often assumed that violent and nonviolent conflicts are *qualitatively* different and have different causes, that assumption is rarely tested empirically. We explore this question with reference to conflicts over self-determination and a focus on the role of ethnic grievances in conflict processes. Combining insights from different theoretical traditions, we develop a new argument that isolates the connection of political exclusion and lost autonomy -- two grievance factors commonly associated with ethnic war -- with the emergence of nonviolent separatist claims and their escalation to violence. Using new data, we find that grievances matter at both conflict stages; however, not all types of grievances matter equally at all stages of conflict. More generally, our analysis suggests that existing models of civil war are not specific enough to explain the outbreak of violence because they neglect the process of conflict escalation."
