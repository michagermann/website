I am a Prize Fellow in Political Science at the University of Bath. 

Much of my research focuses on ethnic conflict and political behavior. In recent work I have I explored the causes of conflicts over territorial self-determination and when and why such conflicts escalate from nonviolence to violence and civil war. Moreover, I have a strong interest in digital democratic innovations, such as Internet voting or Voting Advice Applications, and how they affect political behavior including electoral turnout.

My work has appeared in the [*British Journal of Political Science*](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123415000563), [*Political Communication*](https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2018.1526237), the [*Journal of Conflict Resolution*](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002717735364), [*Electoral Studies*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2017.03.001), and other outlets.
