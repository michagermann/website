abstract: "Deliberative theories of democracy are increasingly catching the interest of activists, policy-makers, and empirical political scientists. However, surprisingly little remains known about the effects of commonly suggested deliberative democratic innovations, such as deliberative mini-publics, on the broader citizenry, as well as their interplay with established democratic institutions. This project provides novel experimental evidence on the polity-level implications of deliberative mini-publics. Our study addresses one of the most significant promises of mini-publics: the claim that mini-publics increase legitimacy perceptions and the willingness to accept unfavorable democratic decisions. Our experimental design builds on a small body of prior work that uses randomized descriptions of fictitious political decision-making processes to compare the effects of different democratic decision-making mechanisms on perceptions of process legitimacy. We go beyond these studies and vary whether, prior to the final decision, a mini-public deliberates on the issue at stake. In combination, this allows us to study the interplay of mini-publics with two traditional forms of democratic decision-making: direct voting in referendums and indirect voting in parliaments. To maximize ecological validity, we conduct our experiment in what is likely to be the only country context in which a majority of voters have heard of deliberative mini-publics and are familiar with their basic workings: the Republic of Ireland."
