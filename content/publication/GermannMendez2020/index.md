abstract: "Does Islamist terrorism affect public opinion in Western democracies? While extant literature is clear that large-scale attacks and especially 9 / 11 had seismic effects, the evidence regarding less major attacks more typical of the recent past is less clear. There is also little consensus on the kind of effects such attacks may have: while terror management theory leads to the expectation that Islamist terrorism will increase ideological polarization, Bayesian updating theory suggests that citizens become more willing to sacrifice civil liberties in favor of security guarantees by the state. Finally, group-based (or ethnocentric) theories suggest that Islamist terrorism will increase in-group identification and, therefore, harden citizensâ€™ stances on immigration in addition to views on law and order. In this paper, we draw on two mass online surveys to estimate the causal effects of the 2017 and 2019 London Bridge attacks. Both surveys were fielded during the time of the attacks and attracted thousands of responses every day. Strengthening causal identification, this unusual set-up allows us to measure shifts in in-group identification and ideological stances over very short time windows while balancing exactly on key confounders.  Placebo tests suggest that there were no unrelated, pre-attack time trends. We find consistent evidence that even minor terrorist attacks affect public opinion. Our results are consistent with ethno-centric theories stressing the role of group-based and ethno-nationalist considerations."
