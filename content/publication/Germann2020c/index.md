abstract: "More than 20 countries have trialed internet voting. Expatriates have been a key target group in several of these trials, often with the goal of increasing the historically low turnout rates among this group of voters. However, to what extent internet voting increases expatriate voter turnout remains unclear. This article provides some of the first evidence on the ability of internet voting to increase expatriate voter turnout based on an analysis of extended internet voting trials in 10 Swiss cantons. For causal identification I exploit variation in the availability of internet voting after a cantonâ€™s first internet voting trial. Such variation emerged due to (often temporary) halts in some of the cantons as well as technical difficulties with the administration of certain election formats. Using difference-in-differences estimation, I find that expatriate voter turnout was 3 to 6 percentage points higher if expatriate voters had the option to cast their votes online, in addition to postal voting."
