abstract: "The international community increasingly promotes referendums as it intervenes in separatist conflicts around the world. Yet much of the existing literature warns against referendums on self-determination, arguing that they are likely to escalate tensions. This paper develops a novel theory suggesting an important revision to the scholarly consensus. Building on the broader literatures on procedural fairness and ethno-nationalism, I argue that self-determination referendums are only likely to descend into violence if they are unilaterally initiated. By contrast, referendums that are mutually agreed by the conflict parties are likely to instill perceptions of fair decision-making and can thereby facilitate peaceful conflict resolution. I find support for my argument in a global statistical analysis (1946-2012); a case study of referendums held in Northern Ireland; and a survey experiment. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that self-determination referendums can make a positive contribution to peace; however, only if the conditions are ripe."
